# Guidelines for the tool presentation

## Task

In a normal working environment, the project manager may ask the developer to
gather more information on a set of tools to perform a given activity, create a
presentation for the rest of the team so later the team can decide to adopt a
new technology in their working flow. We are simulating this scenario in our
classroom.

Every student will receive a category of tools based on the [DevOps periodic
table](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/). Ideally, all the
tools categories (Source Control Management, Continuous Integration, ...) will
be covered. The categories will be assigned to student based on requests if an
agreement is possible, in a randomic way otherwise.

Every presentation will indicatively last 45 minutes (35 minutes of
presentation, 10 minutes of answers).

The presentation may be structured as follows:
* a brief overview of the category chosen
  * what is it?
  * why is it useful?
* presentation of every tool focusing on
  * explain what are they for, when and who developed them
  * what are they offering
  * why someone should use them
  * for every tool what are its major competitors
  * what advantages they offer if used, are there any alternatives
  * are they new or well established
  * possible short demo (if time allows)
* other tools not in DevOps periodic table
  * surf the net (e.g., sites like [https://stackshare.io/](https://stackshare.io/)
    to check if there are additional tools that would fit into the table
  * if tool are important include them in the presentation
  * otherwise mention them en passant
* concluding remarks
  * what is important to know, personal ideas

## Goal

The goal of this presentation are the following:
* show that a student is able to independently retrieve information from
  different sources, compile and summarize this information into a coherent
  presentation given to their peers to foster a selection of what tools to chose
  in their future work,
* show that the students has the social skills to interact with his/her peers to
  convey effectively information and ideas,
* first preliminary part of the final project. 

The students while developing the presentation do not have to aim at given low
level details, but to try instead to emphasize what are the good features of the
tools, how easy is to use them, and in what context they should be used.

It is not a formal presentation. Questions may be asked during the presentation.
Slides are welcomed.

Feedback will be given by the teacher and the students of the course. In case of
negative feedback (e.g., some tools were not presented at all, the presenter did
not provide the reason why the tools are useful, ...), parts of the presentation
may be asked to be improved or detailed at the discretion of the lecturer.

## Evaluation

Important for fulfilling the task:
* Is the information attention-getting? Does it lay out the problem well?
* Are technical terms well-defined? Is the language appropriate for the target
  audience?
* Is there a obvious conclusion summarizing the presentation? Are potential
  weaknesses (if any) in findings summarized?
* Clarity of content? Significance? Right amount of information?
* Response to questions?

Important for personal development:
* Did the presenter stay within the timeframe given?
* Professional and confident?
* Engaged with audience? Eye contact? Appropriately animated (e.g., gestures,
  moving around)?
* Enthusiasm about topic?
* Slides with few text, images, and not distracting?
* Clear voice with good pace? Limited use of filler words (“umm,” “like,”)?

## Tips for presentation

#### Show your Passion and Connect with your Audience
* Connect with your audience by using your passion (hope you are passionate about)
* Be honest about what is important and why it matters.
* Smile and Make Eye Contact with your Audience
* Tell stories if possible (human beings are programmed to respond to stories)

#### Focus on your Audience
* Presentation needs to be built around audience needs (what they will gain).
* Consider required knowledge (experts, non experts, ...).
* Always be conscious of audience’s response. Adapt to them.

#### Keep it Simple: One Core Message if possible
* Be aware what is the key message to take away
* Message should be able to be presented very quickly (30-second ‘elevator
  summary’). Focus and brief.
* Key message can be repeated.
* If things do not contribute to key message, do not say them.

#### Start Strongly
* Beginning is crucial. You need to grab your audience’s attention and hold it.
* Few minutes is a grace period. Use them wisely. Often do not waste time on
  explaining who you are. Start by entertaining them.
* Images on slides

#### Use your Voice/Body Effectively
* Visual aids more important but voice & body are important too
* Varying the speed, emphasizing changes in pitch and tone
* Use your body (~ three quarters of communication is non-verbal)
* Avoid includes crossed arms, hands held behind your back or in your pockets,
  and pacing the stage.

#### 10-20-30 Rule for Slideshows (if you can, but not in our case)
* Contain no more than 10 slides, last no more than 20 minutes, use a font size
  of no less than 30 point (no ‘Death by PowerPoint’).
* Good set of slides should be no use without the presenter (difficult)
* Contain less, rather than more
* No (internal)notes on slides
* Page numbers: avoid if short but useful for Q/A
* Outline: avoid if short time

#### Relax, Breathe and Enjoy
* Rehearse your presentation
* Concentrating on your breathing (slow it down, breathing fully)
* Sip a bit of water
